# BOTL
This git repo has data, data generators and code for the Bi-directional Online Transfer Learning framework (BOTL).

# Available data and data generators and BOTL implementations:
  - Following distance data for 6 journeys (2 drivers).
  - Drifting hyperplane data generator
  - Smart home heating simularion (with real world weather data)

Note the underlying framework is the same for all three implementations. For ease of reproducability all three versions have been added.
